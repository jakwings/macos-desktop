Known Problems
----------------

* Only the picture of the current desktop is set. (: by design :)

* The start-up login screen cannot be customized yet.

* Must enable `System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Options > Display login window as: List of users` in order to customize the lock screen.

* The screenshot above looks unreal. (; yes, the username has been photoshopped away ;)
